# Event Creation and Payment Flow

LeadsCalendar provides users with a seamless process for creating events and making payments within the application. Below is a detailed explanation of the workflow involved in event creation and payment processing:

## Event Creation Process

1. **Navigate to Event Creation Page:**
   - Users log in to LeadsCalendar and navigate to the event creation page.

2. **Enter Event Details:**
   - Users fill out the event details including title, date, time, location, description, and any additional information.

3. **Choose Payment Option:**
   - Users select the payment option for the event:
     - Pay with PayPal: Users can choose to pay for the event using their PayPal account.
     - Pay with Binance Pay: Users can choose to pay for the event using cryptocurrency via Binance Pay.

4. **Submit Event:**
   - After entering all necessary details and selecting the payment option, users submit the event creation form.

## Payment Processing Flow

1. **Initiate Payment:**
   - Upon submission of the event creation form, LeadsCalendar initiates the payment process based on the selected payment option.

2. **Payment Authorization:**
   - If the user chooses to pay with PayPal, LeadsCalendar redirects the user to the PayPal payment page where they authorize the payment using their PayPal account credentials.
   - If the user chooses to pay with Binance Pay, LeadsCalendar generates a payment request and provides the user with a payment URL.

3. **Payment Confirmation:**
   - After successful authorization, PayPal or Binance Pay notifies LeadsCalendar about the completed payment.

4. **Event Confirmation:**
   - Once the payment is confirmed, LeadsCalendar creates the event on the user's Google Calendar and displays a confirmation message to the user.
